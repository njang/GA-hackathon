## Problem Statement
People need an easy way to filter, visualize and consume workplace diversity analytics for state and local government.  

## Hypothesis
We believe that by creating a platform that presents complex government employee demographics in a simple and digestible manner,  we will help government job seekers who value diversity and inclusion make a more informed decision when applying for government employment.

Additionally, by making this data more consumable we anticipate more discussion and awareness about diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
